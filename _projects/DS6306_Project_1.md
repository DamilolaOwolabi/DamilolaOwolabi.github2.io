# Introduction

Good afternoon Mr. Whitworth and Mr. Tennenbaum. We are here today to present the findings from the questions presented to our team of Data Scientist. We will answer the nine questions provided ahead of time with our analysis and visualuations, as well as highlighting any key observations that came up during our review. With that, let us get started as we’re excited to share with you the breakdown of our findings.

#### Agenda 1a: Distribution by State

Loaded files and confirm, how many breweries are located in each state?

      --- R
    #summary(Breweries) #check the type
    
    mean_count <- mean(Breweries$n) #create a column mean_count for the reference line
        
    Breweries %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% ggplot(aes(x = State, y = n, fill = State)) +
      geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme(legend.position = "none") + geom_text(aes(label = n, y = n +1.5)) +
      ggtitle("Count of Breweries by State") + ylab("Count of Breweries") + xlab("State") + 
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
      geom_hline(yintercept = mean_count, linetype = "dotted", color = "red") # to show the mean. #ffh

    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">
    Plot of Count of Breweries by State
</div>

**Analysis: ** We provided a bar chart showing the count of breweries by state. The state with the highest count of breweries is Colorado with 47 breweries. There is a four way tie between DC, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia for the lowest with one brewery each. The mean count of breweries per state is eleven.


#### Agenda 1b: Distribution by State

Load files and confirm, how many breweries are located in each state?

      --- R
      lookup = data.frame(State = state.abb, State_Name = state.name) #makes a dataframe with State na me and state abb. 
      Breweries2 = inner_join(Breweries,lookup, by = "State")
      BreweriesMapData = Breweries2 %>% group_by(State) %>% count(State_Name) #head(BreweriesMapData)
      colnames(BreweriesMapData)[3] = "Breweries" #change 'n' to 'Breweries' BreweriesMapData$region <- tolower(BreweriesMapData$State_Name) #head(BreweriesMapData)
      BreweriesMapData2 = BreweriesMapData[-1] #drop the first column states <- map_data("state")
      map.df <- merge(states, BreweriesMapData2, by = "region", all.x = TRUE) head(map.df)

    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">
    Map of Breweries by State
</div>
      
**Analysis: ** In addition to the bar chart, a heat map showing the distribution of breweries was included. This was added as a “knock their socks off” addition as it enhanced the answer to their question visually.


#### Question 2 - Merge beer data with the breweries data.

Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.

      --- R
      merged_df = merge(Beers,Breweries, by.x = "Brewery_id", by.y = "Brew_ID") #joining when keys do not match
      head(merged_df,6) #to show the first 6 observations
      ---
      
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/DS_6306_Project1/pic19.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">
    Merged dataset
</div>

**Analysis: ** Using merge() we brought in the Breweries csv file against the Beers csv file. The method used was when the two keys were not identical


#### Agenda 2: Missing Values

Address the missing values in each column

      --- R
      #merged_df %>% is.na() #check for missing values , ABV and IBU
      #Cleaning the data
      merged_df <- merged_df %>% na.omit() 
      ---
      
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/DS_6306_Project1/pic20.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">
    Proof of Missing Values
</div>

**Analysis: ** There were 62 missing values from column ABV, approximately three percent of the total. There were 1,005 missing values from column IBU. The data was review and we could not locate a relationship amongst the missing data and the qualifiers. Example, there did not appear to be an observable difference between data missing across the State data, or Brewery data. Overall, it appeared that the data was missing completely at random with no way of back tracking into an answer for the missing values.


#### Agenda 3: Mean ABV %

mean of ABV by State and bar chart

      --- R
      #create a new df to add Mean ABV % 
    merged_df1 <- merged_df %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(meanABV = mean(ABV, na.rm = TRUE)) #ad d column meanABV with the mean of ABV. 
    #confirm meanABV has been added 
    #merged_df1
    #plot to show the meanABV % by state, update labels, remove legend. 
    ggplot(merged_df1, aes(x = State, y = meanABV, fill = State)) + 
    theme(legend.position = "none") + #removed the legend
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + geom_text(aes(label = round(meanABV, 2), y = meanABV + .01), siz e = 2) + #using round for cleaner looking labels
    ggtitle("ABV % mean by State") + xlab("State") + ylab("Mean ABV %") + ylim(0.0,0.1) + #zoom in on the y-axis for small %s
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)
      ---
      
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/DS_6306_Project1/pic3.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">
    Plot of ABV% mean by state
</div>

**Analysis: ** New Mexico has the highest mean Alcohol by Volumne % (ABV %) and Utah has the lowest ABV %. Each state was calculated and a label was added to show each. To prevent overlapping, the size of the mean labels were reduced


#### Agenda 4: Mean IBU 

mean of IBU by State and bar chart

      --- R
      #repeat with IBU
    #create a new dataframe with 
    merged_df2 <- merged_df %>% group_by(State) %>% summarize(meanIBU = mean(IBU, na.rm = TRUE)) #ad d column meanABV with the mean of IBU. 
    #confirm meanIBU has been added 
    #plot to show the meanIBU by state, update labels, remove legend.
    ggplot(merged_df2, aes(x = State, y = meanIBU, fill = State)) + 
    theme(legend.position = "none") + #removed the legend
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + geom_text(aes(label = round(meanIBU, 1), y = meanIBU + 2), size = 2) + #using round for cleaner looking labels
    ggtitle("IBU mean by State") + xlab("State") + ylab("Mean IBU") + ylim(0,60) + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
      ---
      
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/DS_6306_Project1/pic4.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">
    Plot of IBU mean by state
</div>

**Analysis: ** West Virginia has the highest mean International Bitterness Units (IBU). Due to missing values, South Dakota had no data represented. The remaining states with data were calculated and a label was added to show each. To prevent overlapping, the size of the mean labels were reduced.


#### Agenda 5 - Finding the states with the most alcoholic beer and the most bitter beer.

Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer

      --- R
      merged_df <- merged_df %>%  filter(!is.na(ABV)) 
      merged_df %>% group_by(State) %>% ggplot(aes(x = State, y = ABV, fill = State)) + theme(legend.p osition = "none") + geom_boxplot()  + ggtitle("Stem and Box plot of the ABV Values for each stat e")

Valuable insight were also gotten from different categorical variables related to the ABV variable. Looking at the distribution based on the states, the state of Kentucky has the highest ABV value, the state of Oregon has the lowest ABV values, and there were 2 outliers in the plot, belonging the the states of Kentucky and Oregon. Looking at the distribution based on the brewery ID, the Beer “London Balling” with brewery ID #2 has the highest alcoholic content, while the beer “Totally Randler” with brewery ID# 81 has the lowest alcoholic content.

**Analysis: ** Looking at the summary statistics, the minimum value is 4, the 1st quartile value is 21, the Median value is 35, the 3rd Quarter is 64, the maximum value is 138. Valuable insight were also gotten from different categorical variables related to the ABV variable. Looking at the distribution based on the states, the state of Oregon has the highest ABV value, and the state of Carlifornia has the lowest ABV values. Looking at the distribution based on the brewery ID, the Beer “Bitter B***th Imperial IPA” with brewery ID #2 has the highest alcoholic content, while the beer “Summer Solstice” with brewery ID# 81 has the lowest alcoholic content.


#### Agenda 7: Investigating the relationship between the ABV variable and IBU variable

      --- R
      merged_df %>% group_by(IBU) %>% ggplot(aes(y = ABV, x = IBU, color = State)) + geom_point() + gg title("The distribution of the ABV based on each IBU") + theme(legend.position = "none")

    </div>
</div>

<div class="caption">
     distribution of the ABV based on the IBU
</div>

**Analysis: ** There is a positiver linear relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content. We can see from the plot above that for every high value in IBU there is a corresponding high value in ABV.


#### Agenda 8: Investigating the difference between the IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of ales in terms of their IPA and IBU values using KNN classification

We plan on visualizing the dataset

      ---
      # Using KNNs
      set.seed(123)

      #Statistical Evidence
      #Using ttest to compare the mean of IBU and ABV variables Budweiser_IPA = Budweiser_df2 %>% filter(str_detect(Style, "IPA")) Budweiser_Ale = Budweiser_df2 %>% filter(str_detect(Style, "Ale")) t.test(Budweiser_IPA$IBU, Budweiser_Ale$IBU

**Results: **  Using the KNN classificayion, the accuracy was found to be 86%, the Missclassification rate 14%, sensitivity, 90.4%, and the specitivity, 79.8%. Based on the welch’s 2 sample t-test, there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that there is a significant difference between the Ale and IPA drinks in term of their IBU (p-value < 2.2e- 16) and the ABV (P-value < 2.2e-16).


# Conclusion

Utilizing various file manipulation, string manipulation and data visualization techniques, we were able to find valuable insight into the data of US craft beers and US breweries, over the past years.

We were able to discover the distribution of breweries and beers, across different US states. We were also able to address missing values within our generated data, and investigated the effectiveness of the missing values within the dataset. From our investigation, we proved that Removing the missing values didnt affect our data. Statistical analysis was done to find and visualize valuable statistical data like states that produced drinks with the highest average values of the Alcohol by Volume variable and the International Bitterness Unit Variable, the stateswith most alcoholic drink and the most bitter drink. We were able to provide more statistical insight into the Alcohol by beverage data, by looking into their mean, maximum and minimum values, and looking into how they affect different variables like the IBU, the brewery ID, and the states.

Lastly we were able to use kNN, and a ttest to prove that there is a significant relationship between the IPA drinks and the Ale drinks.
